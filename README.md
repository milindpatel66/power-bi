The dashboard visualizes trends, highlighting BJP’s gains. It categorizes seats by general, SC, and ST constituencies. Election commissioners' details and official sources are included. The project leverages Power BI’s data visualization to present insights on party performance, voter turnout, and electoral trends across states.
